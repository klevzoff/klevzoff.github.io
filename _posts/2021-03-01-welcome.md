This is my first post on this blog.
I'm not yet sure whether or not I will be posting here on some kind of semi-regular basis, and on what kind of topics.
If I do, it will hopefully be a healthy mix of technical content and personal updates.

On the technical side, my primary interests include modern C++, GPU programming, high-performance computing, numerical analysis and linear algebra (thanks to my current degree program). I'm also curious about other systems programming languages, in particular Rust that I'm looking forward to learning one day, and some other general programming topics.

I'm still figuring out Jekyll and its themes, and hopefully can make this website a little better. See you soon!
