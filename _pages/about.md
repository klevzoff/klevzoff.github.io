Hello!
My name is Sergey.
I was born and grew up in Sarov, Russia, and presently reside in SF Bay Area, California, USA.

I am currently a PhD candidate at the Department of Energy Resources Engineering at Stanford University.
I hold a BS degree in Applied Math and Computer Science from Moscow State University (Moscow, Russia).

My research interests include subsurface modeling (porous media flow and geomechanics), high-performance computing, GPU programming and parallel scalable linear solvers.
More broadly, I'm interested in using modern C++ and software engineering tools to create performant, portable and maintainable scientific software.

I'm a contributor to the open-source [GEOSX](http://www.geosx.org/) project and previously to Stanford's [AD-GPRS](https://supri-b.stanford.edu/research-areas/ad-gprs) research simulator.

Last but not least, I'm set to graduate in 2021, and will be open to various job opportunities in the United States.
