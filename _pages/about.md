Hello!
My name is Sergey.
I was born and grew up in Sarov, Russia, and currently reside in SF Bay Area, California, USA.

I am a PhD candidate at the Department of Energy Resources Engineering at Stanford University.
I hold a BS degree in Applied Math and Computer Science from Moscow State University (Moscow, Russia) and an MS degree in Energy Resources Engineering from Stanford University.

My academic research interests include subsurface modeling (porous media flow and geomechanics), high-performance computing architectures, parallel programming models and scalable linear solvers.
More broadly, I'm interested in using modern programming languages and software engineering tools to create performant, portable and maintainable software in the areas of scientific computing and beyond.

My primary programming language of choice today is C++ (modern standards, including c++14/17/20). I've been using Python for the past 15 years for all sorts of things, and am currently teaching myself Rust in my free time.

I'm a contributor to the open-source [GEOSX](http://www.geosx.org/) project and previously to Stanford's [AD-GPRS](https://supri-b.stanford.edu/research-areas/ad-gprs) research simulator.

On the personal side, I enjoy indoor volleyball, apline skiing and playing guitar.

Last but not least, I'm set to graduate in June 2022, and will be open to various job opportunities in the United States.
