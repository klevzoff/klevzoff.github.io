Hello!
My name is Sergey.
I was born and grew up in Sarov, Russia, and currently reside in SF Bay Area, California, USA.

I am currently employed as an AI Developer Technology Engineer at NVIDIA. My job involves working with key customers to provide the best AI solutions using GPUs, performing in-depth analysis and optimization to ensure the best performance of customers' code and collaborating with architecture, libraries and product teams across the company to influence the design of next-generation architectures, programming models and software platforms.

Previously I was a PhD student at the Department of Energy Science and Engineering at Stanford University, working in the areas of subsurface modeling (porous media flow and geomechanics), high-performance computing architectures, parallel programming models and scalable linear solvers.
I hold a BS degree in Applied Math and Computer Science from Moscow State University (Moscow, Russia) and an MS degree in Energy Resources Engineering from Stanford University.

More broadly, I'm interested in using modern programming languages and software engineering tools to create performant, portable and maintainable software in the areas of scientific computing, AI and beyond.
My primary programming language of choice today is C++ (14/17/20/23). I've been using Python for the past 15 years for all sorts of things, and am currently teaching myself Rust in my free time.

I'm a contributor to the open-source [GEOSX](http://www.geosx.org/) project and previously to Stanford's [AD-GPRS](https://supri-b.stanford.edu/research-areas/ad-gprs) research simulator.

On the personal side, I enjoy indoor volleyball, apline skiing and playing guitar.
